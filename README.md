# Fine Dine
• Developed a restaurant dine-in system where restaurants sign up on our website to create the menu and generate a unique QR code for every table.

• These unique QR codes are downloaded by the restaurants and kept on every table. Customers download the Android app to order food.

• Customers scan the QR code and the menu card is displayed on the app. Payment is done from their app using Paytm Integrated UPI.

• The Front-End is created using Tailwind.css, Jquery, and the App is created using Material UI and Java, and the back end is created using Flask and Postgres.
